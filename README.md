Sharing my recent project of
Redesigning the website of Swaram Specialty Hospital! 

As a UI/UX designer 🎨 , I had the privilege of redesigning their website to enhance the user experience and align it more closely with the hospital's mission to provide top-notch healthcare services.

Process undergone : ♻️
🔧User research
🔧wireframing
 🔧high-fidelity prototype

Changes Made: ▶️
👷‍♂️ I aimed to simplify navigation, ensuring that patients and visitors can easily find the information they need.
👷‍♂️Booking appointment option is now displayed on the top thus users don't need to scroll long way to find the option
👷‍♂️By incorporating modern design principles and ensuring the site is fully responsive
👷‍♂️ Made the Specialist info boxes as buttons such that they can redirect to book an appointment with the specified specialist.
